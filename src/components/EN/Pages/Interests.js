                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors.  I am an avid biker. During the warmer months here in Leipzig, I enjoy long distance biking walking in the woods, spending some time next to water.</p>
                    <p className="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow movies and television shows, I love to discover how the things work and try to fix them in case something went wrong, this was my hobby since i was kind .</p>
